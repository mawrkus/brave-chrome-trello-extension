<div align="center">

</div>

## Installation

As the extension is not published, the installation takes a bit more time, but is not too complex.

In a terminal, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mawrkus/trello-browser-extension.git
```

(Or you can also download the code directly by clicking on the "[Code" > "Download ZIP](https://github.com/mawrkus/trello-browser-extension/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)" button in GitHub and unzip it in a "brave-chrome-trello-extension" folder on your computer)

- Go to this "url": [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (or [brave://extensions](brave://extensions))
- Activate the "Developer mode" and click on "Load unpacked":
