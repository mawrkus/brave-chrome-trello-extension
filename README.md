# A browser extension for Trello

A browser extension to easily create Trello cards from any Web page in two clicks. Including metadata (title, description) and a cover image.

## Installation

As the extension is not published, the installation takes a bit more time, but is not too complex.

In a terminal, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mawrkus/trello-browser-extension.git
```

Or download the code by clicking on the "[Code" > "Download ZIP](https://github.com/mawrkus/trello-browser-extension/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)" button in GitHub and unzip it in a "brave-chrome-trello-extension" folder on your computer.

### Brave/Chrome users

- Go to this "url": [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (or [brave://extensions](brave://extensions))
- Activate the "Developer mode" and click on "Load unpacked":

- Go to the folder where you've cloned the extension and click "Select". The extension is now installed...

### Firefox users

The installation process is similar, but starts at this "url": [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox). After clicking on "Load Temporary Add-on...", just select the file "manifest-firefox.json".
