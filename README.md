# A Trello extension for Brave and Chrome

*Creating new Trello cards from Web pages made easy.*

## Installation

As the extension is not published in Chrome Web store, the installation is a bit more tedious...

In a terminal:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/mawrkus/brave-chrome-trello-extension.git
  ```

In Brave/Chrome:

- Go to this "url": [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
- Click on "Load unpacked"
- Go to the folder where you've cloned the extension and click "Select", the extension is installed:
